## Connect to the ownCloud Server Using the Desktop Client 
1. On your Windows device, open a web browser and go to the following web site:
```
   https://owncloud.org/download/#owncloud-desktop-client-windows
```
2. In the ownCloud desktop client for Windows table, click **Download** for the **Production** release channel.
3. Double-click the .msi file that is downloaded (for example, ownCloud-2.5.4.11654.11466.msi).
4. Follow the prompts to install ownCloud, selecting the default values. Then, click **Install**.
5. After installing the ownCloud desktop client, the **Installation Wizard** opens. Use the wizard to connect to the ownCloud server.
6. In the **Setup ownCloud server** window, enter the URL of your ownCloud server in the Server Address field. Then, click **Next**.
7. In the **Enter user credentials** window, enter your user name and password. Then, click **Next**.
8. In the **Setup local folder options** window, choose which of your files and folders you want to synchronize with the ownCloud server and the local folder where you want the files and folders to be saved. Then, click **Connect**.

The ownCloud desktop client attempts to connect to your ownCloud server. A successful connection displays two buttons: a button to connect to your ownCloud Web user interface and a button to open your local folder. The synchronization of your files starts.

If the connection fails, contact your administrator for assistance.
